  This class provides a docking engine which uses provided models for
  featurization, pose generation, and scoring. Most pieces of docking
  software are command line tools that are invoked from the shell. The
  goal of this class is to provide a python clean API for invoking
  molecular docking programmatically.

  The implementation of this class is lightweight and generic. It's
  expected that the majority of the heavy lifting will be done by pose
  generation and scoring classes that are provided to this class.
